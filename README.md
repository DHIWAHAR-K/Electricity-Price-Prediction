# Electricity Price Prediction using Python

## Overview

This Python script demonstrates electricity price prediction using machine learning and the `scikit-learn` library. The script utilizes a dataset containing historical electricity prices and applies a regression model for prediction. Explore this script to understand the basics of electricity price prediction in Python.

## Script Components

- **Library Installation:** Installing the necessary libraries (`pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`, and others if required).
- **Dataset Loading:** Loading a dataset containing historical electricity prices.
- **Data Exploration:** Exploring and understanding the structure of the dataset.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning and preparing the dataset for machine learning.
- **Regression Model:** Applying a regression model (e.g., Linear Regression) using `scikit-learn`.
- **Model Evaluation:** Evaluating the model's performance and predicting electricity prices.
- **Visualizing Predictions:** Utilizing `matplotlib` to visualize predicted electricity prices.
- **Output Display:** Displaying the generated visualizations and model performance.

## Running the Script

1. Install the required libraries by running `pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib` in your Python environment.
2. Open and run the Python script (`electricity_price_prediction.py`) in a Python environment.
3. The script will load the electricity price dataset, train a regression model, and generate predictions.

## Customization

- Replace the dataset with your own electricity price-related data for specific prediction.
- Experiment with different regression models and parameters to improve prediction accuracy.
- Modify the script to include additional features or advanced machine learning techniques.
